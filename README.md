# Genetic Algorithms

This is a simple MATLAB implementation of genetic algorithms (GA). Two demos are shown here: First one finds the maximum point of a single-input function. It will show the evolution of the populations and the maximum point. The second one solves the Tower of Hanoi using GA. To run the Tower of Hanoi, follow the instructions inside its folder.

## Getting Started

Download the repo to your MATLAB workspace. To try the maximization problem, open genetic_algorithm.m with MATLAB. Then Simply press 'Run' or hit F5 to see the demo, or type genetic_algorithm() in the command window and hit Enter.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB R2016b
